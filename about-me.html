  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <h2>Education Background</h2>    
  <p>I am a former student of Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology where I studied Entrepreneurship which was mostly about starting and running a business.</p>
  <p>The reasons why I decided to take a class on programming are; I feel that in this day and age, being able to code is a necessity with the rapid growth in technology and I've always had an interest in programming.</p>
